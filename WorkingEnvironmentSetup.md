# Setting up our Working Environment

## Anaconda and Jupyter Notebooks

1. Install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual). Anaconda is a Python distribution with many packages and we will make use of some of them. Pick the **graphical installer**, Python 3.8, for whatever OS (operating system) you are using.
2. Launch Anaconda Navigator.
3. Launch Jupyter Notebook via Anaconda Navigator. Go to the course contents folder and start the notebooks you need.
4. You are now good to go and can save locally too.
